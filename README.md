I recommend beginner Android developers to look through this app's code. A lot of it is 're-compiled' Stack Overflow questions and answers that newbies would search for, so this project may help you fix certain things! A few Java fundamentals are required.

Note: This Android app does not 100% follow the MVVM architecture. It looks like a mess right now but this might/will be fixed in the future.
